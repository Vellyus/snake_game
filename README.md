# snake_game
Snake desktop game. This is from a Youtube guide, although I made some changes to it.
The original version had more food at once, I did not like that, so there is only one food at a time in my version.
In my version the food can not appear on the snake's body and the snake moves quicker as you progress in the game (there is a speed counter)
